			<h2>Secret Identity: Bruce Wayne</h2>
			<img src="hI4Z49az_400x400.jpg" alt="Bruce Wayne" height="300px" width="300px" id="image">
			<p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. His origin depicts 
			Bruce Wayne as a child, after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals,
			an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.

			Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner 
			Jim 
			Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a 
			genius-level intellect, is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry and equipment. A large 
			assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.

			The character became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the following year. As the decades 
			went on, 
			different interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated
			with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with The 
			Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success of Warner Bros. Pictures' live-action Batman feature films have helped maintain the character's
			prominence in mainstream culture.</p>
